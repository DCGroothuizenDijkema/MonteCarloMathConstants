Approximating mathematical constants with Monte Carlo simulations

## Purpose

This repository contains a library written in Fortran for the approximation of mathematical constants. It was originally made to learn Fortran and interfacing compiled code with Python, and to explore Monte Carlo methods.

This library only contains approximations of [e](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)) and [pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi), including visualisations of the simulations used in the approximation. However a similar project was undertaken [here](https://github.com/DCGroothuizenDijkema/LeapingFrog).

## Output

The following two visualisations are examples of that made by the programme:
